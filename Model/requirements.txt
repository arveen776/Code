# Gravity Simulation GUI - Requirements
# 
# This project uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework - included with Python)
# - math (mathematical functions - standard library)
#
# No additional pip packages are required!
#
# Note: On some Linux distributions, tkinter may need to be installed separately:
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#   Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
#   Arch: sudo pacman -S tk

# If you want to add future dependencies, add them below:
# numpy>=1.20.0
